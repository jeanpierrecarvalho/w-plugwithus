This is my portfolio website, proudly built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). The content is managed through [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) and accessed via GraphQL endpoints using [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/).

Previously I built my website using Gatsby, but decided to move over to Next.js due to their major improvements that make it my first choice, not only for applications, but also for websites now.

This project is a constant work in progress, so if you find any bugs, typos or other errors, please feel free to open an issue or pull request. This project is open source, so please feel free to fork and adapt for your own projects (credit would be appreciated).
